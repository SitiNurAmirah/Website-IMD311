<p class="a">  It was the 1st day when I know that we will be under movement control order. It hard to believe that we will stay at home in long time without going out. It's so difficult because it feel empty in mind and thinking what to do the next day. In my mind was thinking "what I want to do next day?" "What will happen if the MCO extended?" "What will happen to my class and my assignment?" It make me sad and worried at the same time. But I know our government doing their best for our country. <i style="font-size:23px" class="fa">&#xf087;</i> </p> 
    
 <br> <img src="images/pua.JPG" alt="minion" width="250" height="220" align="left"> <p class="a"> The first few day of MCO was very confusing. All of us can't go outside even in front of house. I miss hangout with my friends and laughing like crazy with them . My daily routine at home was mostly helping my mother instead of spending time with myself. Everyday, my mother was asking for my siblings and me to help him. I helping him doing the 'pua tampung seribu' which is small cube fold being combine and become the character that want to become. My mother want to make the minion but unfortunately the colour of small cube fold not suitable for minion. The minion's clothes should yellow colour but my mother and I using green colour instead. I happy can help my mum even though I not good enough. </p>

 <p class="a"> Thus, I helping my younger sister by teaching him study. I will teach him study in the evening and night in 2 hours per day. It will help him to improve the knowledge to remember every subject without forgetting when we under the MCO. The teachers giving the exercises in the group whatsapp that will update any new exercises that might help my sister. It easier to teaching my sister when having the exercises for him. Altought I helping him, I currently studying for the test and making the assignment that being given. Miss Suhaida also giving me individual assignment for me to submit and making the recorded video. I was sending the individual assignment using email. </p>
    
 <P class="a"> Besides that, I also helping my mother making the dessert for the family, Nowadays, the weather very hot although we don't go outside the house. It making us become easily exhausted and thirsty. I helping him making the cheese cake. We put the cheese cake into the container and decorate the surface with cheese grater. </P>
